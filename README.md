# **Recommendation:**
We recommend using OldRBXIcons with Bloxstrap to get full experience. (https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap)

# **Does it uses scripts?**

Nope. It's just change of the files. It's way long to search for them, so they are put in one collection.

# **How to install it?**

In the folder there's a file called "OPENME".

# **Will OLDRBXIcons be in developement for a long time?**

Yes, untill Roblox disables the feature of changing the files.

# **Is there a port for a Android or iOS?**

Nope and never will be. OldRBXIcons is designed only for PC.
